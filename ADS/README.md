# Advanced Data Structures using C

## Overview
This repository contains implementations of advanced data structures using the C programming language. The folder `ADS` is organized into two lab cycles, each focusing on different sets of data structures and algorithms.

## Lab Cycle 1
Lab Cycle 1 covers fundamental data structures. Each topic is implemented in a separate file with detailed comments and explanations.

1. **Array**: Implementation of basic array operations including insertion, deletion, and traversal.
2. **Stack**: Implementation of stack operations using arrays and linked lists.
3. **Queue**: Implementation of queue operations using arrays and linked lists.
4. **Circular Queue**: Implementation of circular queue operations.
5. **Linked List**: Implementation of singly linked list operations.
6. **Doubly Linked List**: Implementation of doubly linked list operations.
7. **Circular Linked List**: Implementation of circular linked list operations.
8. **Set using Bit String**: Implementation of set operations using bit strings.

## Lab Cycle 2
Lab Cycle 2 focuses on more advanced data structures and algorithms, particularly those used in graph theory and sorting.

1. **Binary Search Tree**: Implementation of binary search tree operations including insertion, deletion, and traversal.
2. **Prim's Algorithm**: Implementation of Prim's algorithm for finding the minimum spanning tree of a graph.
3. **Kruskal's Algorithm**: Implementation of Kruskal's algorithm for finding the minimum spanning tree of a graph.
4. **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: Implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest path in a graph.
5. **Topological Sorting**: Implementation of topological sorting for directed acyclic graphs.
6. **DFS (Depth-First Search)**: Implementation of depth-first search algorithm.
7. **BFS (Breadth-First Search)**: Implementation of breadth-first search algorithm.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/tvmcoder/s1.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the `ADS` folder:
   ```sh
   cd s1/ADS
   ```
3. Compile and run the C programs using a C compiler like `gcc`:
   ```sh
   gcc filename.c 
   a.exe
   ```
